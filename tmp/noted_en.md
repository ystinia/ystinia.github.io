ArtistIdeal, Sanremo, Liguria,
Italy - On-site
June 2023 - Present

Since June 2023, I have been collaborating with Artistideal, an association dedicated to creative freedom and artistic
expression...
Artistideal offers painting courses and creative spaces, allowing artists to express what the human eye does not immediately
perceive, emphasizing reflection, observation, and emotion, free from limits and stereotypes...
Within the association, I organize art presentations for children, designing interactive activities and workshops that help
them develop their imagination and creativity. My goal is to inspire them to explore their expressive potential through
stimulating and inclusive artistic pathways...
